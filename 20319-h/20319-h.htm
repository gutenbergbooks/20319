<h2>THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(<i>A Characteristic Welcome to the Coming Year.</i>)</p>

<p>It was on the 31st of December that they met. It had been arranged
that at the final hour of the last day of the expiring year they
should compare notes, and not one of them had failed to keep the
appointment.  It would be scarcely right to say they were cheerful,
but merriment was not included in the programme.</p>

<p class="caption">The Military Man</p>
</div>

<p>"There is not the slightest chance of my bettering myself," said
the Military Man. "Now that the Regiment has come from India, I can't
afford to live at home, and I can't exchange because of my
liver. Promotion was never slower than in 'Ours,' and my look-out is
about the most ghastly there ever yet was seen."</p>

<p class="caption">The Briefless Barrister</p>
</div>

<p>"You are wrong there," observed the Briefless Barrister of mature years.
"I think mine is a shade worse. I give you my word that during the last
twelve months I have not earned enough fees to pay the rent of my
Chambers and the salary of my Clerk. And things are getting worse and
worse. One of the Solicitors who used to give me an occasional turn has
been struck off the Rolls, and the other, has transferred his business
to Australia. I feel inclined to follow, but I can't raise the
passage-money. What luck, now, could be worse than mine?"</p>

<p>"Why mine," answered the Author. "An entirely new set of men have come
to the front since I was popular, and my works are a drug in the market.
I haven't been able to get rid of more than a dozen pages during the
twelve months, and they appeared in a Magazine that stopped before the
appearance of the next number! The future never looked blacker and more
hopeless. I believe I am the most unfortunate man on earth."</p>

<p class="caption">The Actor who has his Head turned with
Applause.</p>
</div>

<p>"I fancy you are wrong," put in the Doctor. "I think my look-out worse
than yours. Sold my practice seven years ago to flutter on the Stock
Exchange. Lost my money in seven minutes, and have never had a patient
since. I went to West Slocum (my old home) the other day, and found the
place occupied by three Doctors, and the local Undertaker told me there
was not room enough for one! Talk about luck, I am the unluckiest dog in
the world!"</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," said the Actor, "here
have I been 'resting' for the last twelve months, and it seems just as
likely as not that I shall continue the operation until '94. I have
tried everything in Town and the Provinces, and there isn't an opening
anywhere. My fate is about the worst of the lot."</p>

<p class="caption">The Artist.</p>
</div>

<p>"Not so bad as mine," grumbled the Artist. "Haven't
sold a single picture since the Jubilee year, and can't afford to pay
the frame-maker.  My studio is full of paintings, and the dealers say
that there isn't a single canvas amongst the lot but what would be
refused admission to an Exhibition of Sign-boards! Don't know how I
should have kept body and soul together if it hadn't been for an
opportune loan from one who in happier times was, in my employment as
a model. Talk about prospects!  Look at mine!"</p>

<p class="caption">Bulls and Bears. City Men.</p>
</div>

<p>"Well, come, you are better off than I am," said the City Man. "If I
hadn't now and again to appear before the Registrar in the Bankruptcy
Court, I don't know what I should do with my time! I am stone broke.
That's about it&mdash;stone broke! Knocked out of the 'House,' and without a
scrap of credit: I am done for!"</p>

<p>And it was agreed that none of them had any prospects. Then they
separated, or rather, were on the eve of separating.</p>

<p>"By the way&mdash;fancy forgetting to do it!" said one of them.</p>

<p>And then they rectified the omission, and wished one another, "A Happy
New Year!"</p>

<h2>THE FEAST OF REASON UP TO DATE.</h2>

<p>The old Alchemist smiled as he watched the crucible on the glowing
coals. The fumes rose, and he inhaled them with delight.</p>

<p>It was a triumph. Yes, he was able to go forth a conqueror. It mattered
not where he wandered, for all flew from before him. He seemed to
possess some subtle power that no one understood, but which was
all-conquering. After a lengthened absence he returned to England.</p>

<p>At his Club he met one of his friends&mdash;a doctor.</p>

<p>"I will tell you my adventures," said the old Alchemist, lighting a
strong cigar. "You must know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know everything," said the Physician, sternly. "I know why you have
scared the Arabs, and why disease cannot touch you. The secret is
revealed by a recent <i>Lancet</i>. You can brave disease and death, because
<i>you are fond of eating onions</i>!"</p>

<p>Seeing that his secret was known, the old Alchemist heaved a heavy sigh,
and disappeared, perchance for ever!</p>

<h3>"Tinned Dinners."</h3>

<p><i>&Agrave; propos</i> of an interesting article in the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i> last Thursday on this subject, the problem that most
naturally suggests itself is, "How about the dinner, if you haven't
any tin?" "No Song, No Supper" is pleasantly alliterative, but is not
of universal application.  "No tin, no dinner," may pass into a
proverb, but, anyhow, it's a fact.</p>

If I did not see her daily.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Oh, how gaily</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17.5em;">She could flirt!</span><br />
<br />
Flirt with me, or flirt with others,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">With my brothers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17.5em;">Just as well,</span><br />
<br />

<h2>A GRAND OLD DIARY FOR 1893.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(<i>Published in Advance.</i>)</p>

<p><i>January.</i>&mdash;As I am in Biarritz, may just as well see how they manage
things in Spain. Looked up the Ministry at Madrid, and drafted them a
treaty with Portugal. They thanked me with the courtesy of hidaljos, but
refused with the paltry jealousy of a petty-fogging second-rate Power!
What nasty pride! Sent home to one of my Magazines, "How I took part in
a Bull-fight."</p>

<p><i>February.</i>&mdash;Opened Parliament and set things going, and then thought I
might take a trip to Russia to fill up the odd time. Had a chat with the
<span class="smcap">Czar</span>, and knocked off a plan for the introduction of "Home Rule." <span class="smcap">Czar</span>
polite, but didn't see it. Well of course every one has a right to his
own opinions, still I think it would do. <span class="smcap">Czar</span> didn't. Sent home to one
of my Magazines, "How I lived for three days in the Mines of Siberia."</p>

<p><i>March.</i>&mdash;Back to town for a few days, and then off again. <span class="smcap">Clark</span> says
travelling the best thing in the world for superfluous energy. Did China
thoroughly. Drew up a plan for altering the language, manners,
religions, politics, and customs of the Chinese. Brought it before a
Special Committee of Mandarins; but they prevaricated, and practically
shelved it. Sent home to one of my Magazines an article, "How I had a
Boxing-match with the Emperor of <span class="smcap">China</span>, and knocked his Majesty out of
time."</p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;Things going on decently well at Westminster, so started for
Turkey. Arranged Turkish Finance for the Grand Vizier. But that official
distinctly an&mdash;well, not a wise man&mdash;said he would knock out a better
budget himself. Sent home to one of my Magazines, "My Fortnight's
Manoeuvres with the Bashi Bazouks."</p>

<p><i>May.</i>&mdash;Dropped in at St. Stephen's, and put a few finishing touches to
one or two measures, then away to Egypt. Sketched out a Republican form
of Government for the Khedive. However, his Highness did not seem to see
it. The Egyptians are very Conservative in their notions. Sent home to
one of my Magazines, "A Fortnight in the <span class="smcap">Mahdi's</span> Camp, by an
Acquaintance of <span class="smcap">Osman Digna</span>."</p>

<p><i>June.</i>&mdash;Attended a couple of Cabinet Meetings, and then to America for
a jaunt. Gave the President a carefully worked-out scheme for converting
the Government of the United States into a Monarchy of limited
liability. The President greatly pleased, but not quite sure it would
work. The Americans are sadly behind the age. Sent home to one of my
Magazines, "How to see the World's Fair at Chicago in Twenty Minutes, by
One who has done it."</p>

<p><i>July.</i>&mdash;Session nearly out. Took part in a debate or two and then off
to the North Pole in a balloon. Managed to see a good deal of snow and
ice, and fancy we caught a sight of the Pole itself. Sent home (by
parachute) to one of my Magazines, "How I got within Measurable Distance
of the Moon."</p>

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;Just back to Westminster for a couple of days to wind up the
Session, then away to India. Went on my own responsibility to see the
Ameer of <span class="smcap">Afghanistan</span>. Drew up a treaty in draft to be signed by the
Ameer and the Emperor of <span class="smcap">Russia, Czar</span> was immensely pleased and wanted
to make me Prince of <span class="smcap">Crim Tartary</span>. Sent to one of my Magazines. "How I
shot my first Wild Elephant."</p>

<p><i>September.</i>&mdash;Returned to Hawarden for the inside of a week and then
paid my hurried visit to Australia. Submitted to the Colonies a scheme
for "A Federal Association for the encouragement of the Naturalisation
of the Rabbit in Australasia." The proposal fell rather flat. Find the
rabbit is already known in these places. Sent home to one of my
Magazines an article entitled, "My Prize-fight with the Kangaroo, and
how I won it."</p>

<p><i>October.</i>&mdash;In London for a few days, then to Mexico. Saw the President,
and suggested the revival of the Empire. President very rude; told me to
mind my own business. Sent home to one of my Magazines, "A Week on the
Prairies Buffalo lassooing."</p>

<p><i>November.</i>&mdash;Popped in at Midlothian, and made a speech or two, and then
hurried away to Norway and Sweden. Tried to induce them to give up
<i>their</i> form of Home Rule, which, as all the world knows, has been a
failure. Wanted them to take our Irish edition. They asked me "if it had
been a success?" Stumped! Sent to one of my Magazines, "How to take a
Photograph by Midnight Sunlight, by One who has done it."</p>

<p><i>December.</i>&mdash;Obliged to stay at home, because I think we are going to
change our Town-house. Downing Street most convenient, but question
whether I shall be able to get a renewal of the lease next year.
Sketched out the <i>scenario</i> of the Drury Lane Pantomime; but Sir
<span class="smcap">Augustus</span> prefers his own. Well, well, youth will have its way. Sent in
my special article for Christmas and the New Year, "The History of the
World, from the Earliest Times to the close of the Nineteenth Century,
by One who has employed his leisure moments in its compilation." And
here I may conclude, by wishing everybody "A Happy New Year."</p>

<h3>TRIFLES.</h3>

<p class="subtitle">(<i>From Our Special Autolycus.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Oscar Browning</span> has republished, with other Historical Essays, his
account of the Flight to Varennes, in which he demonstrates that <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>
was hopelessly wrong in the narrative which glows through the most
famous and fascinating chapter in <i>The French Revolution</i>. There seems
no doubt about it; but <span class="smcap">Autolycus</span> says, he knows a man who would rather
be wrong with <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span> than right with O. B.</p>

<hr  class="short" />

<p>Met the Duke of <span class="smcap">Sotto-Voce</span> to-day. Evidently in most doleful dumps. "No,
it's not the weather, <span class="smcap">Autolycus</span>," he said. "Fact is that, although
supposed to be a rich man, I am reduced to extremities. Lunched
yesterday at the Carlton off dish of braised ox-tail, and supped at
night at Beefsteak on cow-heel <i>&agrave; la cordonnier.</i>"</p>

<hr  class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">Autolycus</span> hears that, early in the New Year, Mr. <span class="smcap">Armitstead</span>, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Gladstone's</span> host in the South of France, will be raised to the Peerage,
under the title of Baron <span class="smcap">Biarritz Of Barmouth</span>. "Pau! Pau!" said Mr.
<span class="smcap">Stuart-Rendell</span>, when the rumour reached him. "What are Barmouth and
Biarritz? I took Mr. G. on to the Pyrenees, and Cannes. If a fresh
Barony is to be created for <span class="smcap">Armitstead</span>, what shall I have?" "Why, a
Canne'd one," said <span class="smcap">Algy West</span>, who is always <i>so</i> ready. (<i>Signed</i>)
<span class="smcap">Autolycus</span>.</p>

<hr  class="short" />

<p>"<span class="smcap">The Liberator Building Society</span>:"&mdash;To liberate, means, "make free." If
the present charges are proven, the title will be rather appropriate,
considering how very free it seems to have made with a considerable
amount of property.</p>

<h2>THE MAN WHO WOULD.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">V.&mdash;THE MAN WHO WOULD BRING AN ACTION FOR LIBEL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following incident in the career of <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> was recalled to memory
by an article in a literary journal. An author was airing his
grievances; among them this,&mdash;that writers of repute occasionally lend
their names and pens to obscure or unsuccessful papers for a
consideration, without asking how the usual staff of the paper is paid.
These, indeed, are delicate inquiries. Part of the plaint was expressed
in the following sentence:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"When a journal makes a call upon a good author, and in the pages of<br />
which he can gain neither honour nor renown, from which, as a matter of<br />
taste, he would shrink, under ordinary circumstances, from contributing to,<br />
that journal ought to be subjected to careful scrutiny."<br />
</p>

<p>Now what can this possibly be supposed to mean?&mdash;</p>

<p>"When a journal makes a call upon a good author, <i>and</i> in the pages of
which he can gain neither honour nor renown," (why "and"?) "from which"
(namely, "honour and renown") "he would shrink" (why should he shrink
from renown and honour?) "from contributing to," (and how can he
contribute to honour and renown?) "that journal ought to be subjected to
careful scrutiny." "From which he would shrink from contributing to,"
what have we here? Surely it is the grammar that needs careful scrutiny,
and surely, in no circumstances, could a lofty "rate of pay" be
conferred on a style of this description.</p>

<p>It is natural to reflect that a writer in this unconventional manner has
mainly to thank himself for any want of success which he, and we, may
regret; and that reflection, again, suggests the case of <span class="smcap">Browzer</span>, the
Man who would bring an Action for Libel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Browzer</span> had a small patrimony, any amount of leisure, and a good deal of
ambition. He liked the society of literary gentlemen, he envied their
buoyant successes, such as being "interviewed,", and sorrowed with their
sorrows, such as being reviewed. He listened to their artless gossip,
and fancied himself extremely knowing. In these circumstances of
temptation, <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> fell, as many better men have done, and wrote a
Novel. He drew on the recollections of his suburban youth; he revived
the sorrows of his sole flirtation; he sketched his aunts with a
satirical hand, and he produced a packet of manuscript weighing about
7-1/2 lbs. This manuscript he sent, first, to a literary man, whose name
he had seen in the papers, with a long and fulsome letter, asking for an
opinion. The parcel came back next day, accompanied by a lithographed
form of excuse. <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> denounced the envy and arrogance of mankind, and
sent his parcel to a publisher. He carefully set little traps, with
pieces of adhesive paper, every here and there, to detect carelessness
on the side of the reader. The parcel came back in a week, with a note
of regret that the novel was not suitable. Only one of <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> pieces
of adhesive paper had been removed, but the others were carefully
initialled. A modest author would have concluded that his opening
chapters condemned him, but <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> wrath against mankind only burned
the more fiercely. He removed his traps, however, and sent <i>Wilton's
Wooing</i> the round of the Row. It always came back, "returning like the
peewit," at uncertain intervals. It was really a remarkable manuscript,
for it was written in black ink, blue ink, red ink, pencil, and
stylograph; moreover, most of it was inscribed on the margins, the
original copy having been erased, in favour of improved versions.
Finally <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> discovered a publisher who would take <i>Wilton's Wooing</i>,
on conditions that the author should pay &pound;150 for preliminary expenses
(exclusive of advertising, for which a special charge was to be made),
would guarantee the sale of 300 copies, and would accept half profits on
the net results of the transaction.</p>

<p>The work saw the light, and, externally, it certainly did look very like
a novel. The reviews, which <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> read with frenzied excitement, also
looked very like reviews of novels. They were usually about two inches
in length, and generally ended by saying that "Mr. <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> has still
much to learn." Some of them condensed <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> plot into about eight
lines, in this manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He was a yearning psychologist&mdash;she was a suburban flirt. He sighed,
and analysed; she listened, and yawned. Finally, she went on the stage,
and he compiled this record of the stirring transaction."</p>

<p>But at last there came a longer criticism of <i>Wilton's Wooing</i> in the
<i>Erechtheum</i>. Somebody took <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> to pieces, averring that "Mr.
<span class="smcap">Browzer</span> has neither grammar" (here followed a string of examples of
<span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> idioms) "nor humour," (here came instances of his wit and
fancy), "nor taste" (again reinforced by specimens), "nor even knowledge
of the French language, which he habitually massacres." (Here followed
<i>&agrave; l'outrance, b&ecirc;te noir, soubriquet</i>, all our old friends.) Finally,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> was informed that many fields of honourable distinction
might be open to him, but that a novelist he could never be.</p>

<p>The wrath of <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> was magnificent. He went about among his friends,
who told him that the critique was clearly by that brute <span class="smcap">St. Clair</span>; they
knew his hand, they said; a confounded, conceited pendant, and a
stuck-up puppy. The review was calculated to damage the sale of any
book; it was a dastardly attack on <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> reputation as a man of wit
and humour, a linguist, and a grammarian. They thought (as <span class="smcap">Browzer</span>
wished to know) that an action would lie against the reviewer, or the
review. <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> went to a Solicitor, who espoused his cause, but without
enthusiasm. The name of the reviewer was demanded. Now <span class="smcap">St. Clair</span> was not
the reviewer; the critic was a man just from College, hence his fresh
indignation. Whether for the sake of diversion, or for the
advertisement, the critic wished himself to bear the brunt of <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span>
anger, and the <i>Erechtheum</i> handed him over to justice; his name was
<i>Smith</i>. This damped <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> eagerness; no laurels were to be won from
the obscure <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. The advocate of that culprit made out a case highly
satisfactory to the learned Judge, who had been a reviewer himself upon
a time. He showed that malice was out of the question; <span class="smcap">Smith</span> had never
heard <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> name, nor <span class="smcap">Browzer</span>, <span class="smcap">Smith's</span> (in this instance) before the
book was published. He called several professors of the French tongue,
to prove that <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> French was that usual in fiction, but not the
language of <span class="smcap">Moli&egrave;re</span>, or of the Academy. He left no doubt on the question
of grammar. As to the wit and pathos, he made much mirth out of them. He
cross-examined <span class="smcap">Browzer</span>: had other reviews praised him? Had publishers
leaped eagerly at his work? On what terms was it published? <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span>
answer appeared to show that <i>Wilton's Wooing</i> was not regarded as a
masterpiece by the Trade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> advocate put it that <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> was being crushed by unfair
ridicule on his first entry into a noble profession, or art, that of
<span class="smcap">Scott</span> and <span class="smcap">Fielding</span>. He spoke of mighty poets in their misery dead. He
drew a picture of <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> agonies of mind. He showed that masterpieces
had, ere now, been rejected by the publishers. He denounced the licence
of the Press. Who was an unheard-of <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, who had written nothing, to
come forward and shout at <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> from behind the hedge of the
anonymous? The novelist was a creature of delicate organisation; he
suffered as others did not suffer; his only aim was to lighten care, and
instruct ignorance. Why was <i>he</i> to be selected for cruel sarcasm and
insult?</p>

<p>The learned Judge summed-up dead against <span class="smcap">Browzer</span>. <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> had published
a book, had invited criticism, and then, when he only got what his work
merited, he came and asked for damages.</p>

<p>The question of malice he left to the Jury, who must see that the Critic
and Author had each been ignorant of the other's existence.</p>

<p>The Jury did not deliberate long. They brought in a verdict for <span class="smcap">Browzer</span>,
damages &pound;500, and costs.</p>

<p>The advertisement, the publicity, caused <i>Wilton's Wooing</i> to be eagerly
asked for. <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> book went into ten editions, and a large issue, at
six shillings. Next year <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> publishers proved that he owed them
&pound;37 14s. 6d. This was disappointing, and even inexplicable, but
<span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> fortune was made, and now he is much lauded by all the
reviewers.</p>

<p>The Foreman of the Jury is my grocer, and I ventured, in the confidence
of private life, to question the justice of the verdict. "Well," he
said, "you see it comes to <i>this</i>: where is this to stop? Mr. <span class="smcap">Browzer</span>,
he sells novels; I sell groceries."</p>

<p>"Excellent of their kind!" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Well, I try to give satisfaction; and so does
Mr. <span class="smcap">Browzer</span>. If that young
Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span> writes to the papers that my
sugars are not original, that I plagiarise them from a sand-bunker, or
that my teas are not good Chinese,&mdash;like
Mr. <span class="smcap">Browzer's</span> French, which is what is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
usual in the Trade,&mdash;why, then, he interferes with my business. I
bring my action, and hope to win it; and so, as a tradesman, I feel
that Mr. <span class="smcap">Browzer</span> was wronged." There was no
reply to these arguments, but I pity the Reviewers.</p>

<p>The worst thing about Mrs. <span class="smcap">Henniker's</span> new Novel, published by <span class="smcap">Hurst and
Blackett</span>, is its title. There is a <i>London-Journal</i>ish,
penny-plain-twopence-coloured smack about <i>Foiled</i> which is misleading.
My Baronite says he misses the re-iterated interjection which should
accompany the verb. "Ha! Ha! Foiled!!" would seem to be more the
thing&mdash;but it isn't. The story is a simple one,
wound about an old theme. It is well constructed, and admirably
told. All the characters are what are called Society people; but
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Henniker</span> has studied them in the
drawing-room, not from the area-railings, and reproduces them on her
page with vivid strokes. Some of her acquaintances will probably feel
uneasy when they read about <i>Lord Huddersfield</i>; whilst others
will be quite sure that (among their sisters), they
recognise <i>Mrs. Anthony Gore</i>. Those not in Society of to-day
will find reminiscences of <i>Becky Sharp</i> in <i>Mrs. Gore</i>;
whilst big-boned, good-natured, simple-hearted
<i>Anthony</i>, pleasantly recalls <i>Major Dobbin</i>. The book is full of shrewd
observation, and fine touches of character-drawing, with refreshing
oases of flower-garden and moor in Yorkshire and Scotland.</p>

<hr />

<p>Those who like a good "gashly" book should, my Baronite says, forthwith
send for <i>Lord Wastwater</i> (<span class="smcap">Blackwood</span>). The plot is so eerie, and its
conclusion so incredulous, that the practised novel-reader, seeing
whither he is being led, almost up to the last page expects the
threatened blow will be averted by some more or less probable agency.
But Mr. (or Miss) <span class="smcap">Sydney Bolton</span> is inexorable. <i>Lord Wastwater</i> is dead
now, and there can be no harm in saying that the House of Lords is well
rid of his impending company. He would have made a sad Duke.</p>

<p>A little more than a year ago, in celebration of the seventieth birthday
of <span class="smcap">Henriette Ronner</span>, there was published a volume containing
reproductions in photogravure of some of the works of that charming
painter. Madame <span class="smcap">Ronner</span> knows the harmless, necessary cat as intimately
as <span class="smcap">Rosa Bonheur</span> knows the horse or the ox. She has painted it with
loving hand, in all circumstances of its strangely-varied life. No one
knows, my Baronite says, how pretty and graceful a thing a cat is, till
they study it with the assistance of Madame <span class="smcap">Ronner</span>. <span class="smcap">Cassells</span> afford
opportunity of making this study by presentation of a new and cheaper
edition of the volume, with cats in all attitudes purring round an
interesting essay on themselves, and their Portraiture, contributed by
Mr. <span class="smcap">H. M. Spielmann</span>.</p>

<h2>THE YOUNG GUARD.</h2>

<p>
"<i>Old Sentry.</i> For this relief, much thanks; 'tis bitter
cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I am sick at heart."&mdash;<i>Hamlet.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>
First Sentry-go! Night, stars and snow!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The air bites shrewdly, nipping, eager,</span><br />
As in old Denmark long ago.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A long, long watch through storm and leaguer</span><br />
That dim, departing Sentinel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has held. He hails the Young Guard's entry&mdash;</span><br />
"Who goes there?" "Friend!" "Pass, friend!" "All's well!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tired age retreats&mdash;fresh youth's on sentry.</span><br />
<br />
All's Well? Why that's a formal hail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Guard to Guard. "Not a mouse stirring,"</span><br />
<i>Francisco</i> cried, chill, sleepy, pale.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No bat through night-wastes wheeling, whirring;</span><br />
No trumpet's shrill, no rocket's roar.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And here all seems as calm and quiet</span><br />
As on the heights of Elsinore,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Save for far sounds of wassail riot.</span><br />
<br />
Some "wake to-night and take their rouse"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In England as in Denmark, doubtless,</span><br />
But here calm broods on midnight's brows;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The flag clings to the flag-staff, floutless;</span><br />
And if ghosts walk&mdash;well, youngling Year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With hints of spectres why alarm you?</span><br />
Take your first watch, boy, void of fear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With hope, that inward fire, to warm you!</span><br />
<br />
The Old Guards know that youthful glow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is not the only thing that's needed</span><br />
For a long spell of Sentry-go;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when were veteran croakings heeded?</span><br />
And if they were, would carking care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not wrinkle boy-brow prematurely?</span><br />
All's well&mdash;to-night. May your watch fare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Serenely, steadfastly, securely.</span><br />
<br />
Angels and ministers of grace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Defend you from all spooks alarming!</span><br />
There's something in your younker face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That even ghosts should find disarming.</span><br />
They come in questionable shapes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those phantoms of the Social Crisis.</span><br />
Are their cries menaces&mdash;or japes?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These be <i>our</i> Mysteries of Isis!</span><br />
<br />
The Citadel you have to ward<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is old, and forces new are mustering.</span><br />
Vigilant valour will afford<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More help, my boy, than fear or flustering.</span><br />
Young <span class="smcap">Harry</span> with his beaver up<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should be your model, my young "nipper!"</span><br />

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> never could persuade <span class="smcap">George the Fourth</span> that he
was not present at Waterloo. One day his <span class="smcap">Majesty</span>, talking over the
table, said to his Grace, "I perfectly well remember your crying to the
Grenadiers, 'Up, Guards, and at them!'" "Yes, Sire," replied the Duke,
"so I have been told before." The King smiled at the jest, but never
forgave the carefully-concealed sarcasm.</p>

<h3>ODE TO SAPONACEA.</h3>

<p>
Who claims my strongest missing noun,<br />
When sheets as soft and white as down,<br />
Return in colour yellowy-brown?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">My Laundress!</span><br />

Who by her science can convert<br />
My best and most expensive shirt<br />
Into a miracle of dirt?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">My Laundress!</span><br />
<br />
Who, when my collars come back frayed,<br />
Receives my protests undismayed,<br />
And merely wishes to be paid?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">My Laundress!</span><br />
<br />
Who spite of warnings that one gives,<br />
Turns cambric kerchiefs into sieves,<br />
Or ragged trellis-work&mdash;and lives!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">My Laundress!</span><br />
<br />
Who at the wash-tub, truth to tell,<br />
Is partly fraud and partly sell,<br />
Yet does her "mangling" very well?<br />

<h3>THE POET'S LOVE.</h3>

<p>
My Lady's name I cannot state,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">At different times I greet her</span><br />
As <span class="smcap">Chloe</span>, <span class="smcap">Amaryllis</span>, <span class="smcap">Kate</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">According to the metre;</span><br />
</p>
<div class="figright" style="width:25%">
<a href="images/309-5.png">
<img src="images/309-5.png" alt="" width="100%" />
</a>
</div>
<p>
I've called her <span class="smcap">Mabel</span> many a time,&mdash;<br />
A name which leads itself to rhyme.<br />
<br />
My Lady's hair is sometimes black<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To match her sable dresses,</span><br />
At others falls about her back<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In glorious auburn tresses,</span><br />
Yet do not take me to imply<br />
She's given to the use of dye.<br />
<br />
I like her when she's sweet and small,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The daintiest of flowers,</span><br />
I love her when, divinely tall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above the rest she towers;</span><br />
And yet, as second thoughts suggest,<br />
Perhaps a golden mean were best.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, a simple rustic maid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She strays through meadows green,</span><br />
Sometimes her beauty is displayed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In glittering ball-room scene;</span><br />
More recently I've thought upon<br />
Creating her a lady-Don.<br />
<br />
This peerless girl of whom I speak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I ever worship blindly</span><br />
And sing her praises once a week,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If editors are kindly;</span><br />
Alas, this paragon, I own,<br />
Exists within my verse alone!<br />
